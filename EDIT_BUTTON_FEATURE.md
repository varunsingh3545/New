# Edit Button Feature Added to Article Approving Page

## Enhancement Summary

Added an **Edit** button to the article approving page (`PendingPosts.tsx`) to allow administrators to edit pending articles before approving them.

## Changes Made

### 1. PendingPosts Component (`src/pages/admin/PendingPosts.tsx`)

**Added:**
- Import for `useNavigate` from React Router
- Import for `Edit` icon from Lucide React  
- `handleEditPost` function to navigate to edit page
- Edit button in the action buttons section

**Features:**
- **Edit Button**: Styled as secondary variant with Edit icon
- **Navigation**: Routes to `/edit/{postId}` using existing EditBlog component
- **Responsive Layout**: Added `flex-wrap` to button container for better mobile experience

### 2. ApprovedPosts Component (`src/pages/admin/ApprovedPosts.tsx`)

**Enhanced:**
- Added `Edit` icon to existing edit button for visual consistency
- Maintained existing functionality (button was already present)

## Button Layout

The action buttons on each post card now appear in this order:
1. **Approve** (green, with CheckCircle icon)
2. **Reject** (outline, with XCircle icon) 
3. **Edit** (secondary, with Edit icon) ← **NEW**
4. **Delete** (destructive, with Trash2 icon)

## Technical Details

- **Route**: Uses existing `/edit/:id` route that leads to `EditBlog` component
- **Navigation**: Leverages React Router's `useNavigate` hook
- **Consistency**: Edit button styling matches existing design patterns
- **Accessibility**: Includes both icon and text for clarity

## Benefits

1. **Workflow Efficiency**: Admins can edit posts directly from the approval page
2. **Content Quality**: Allows for quick corrections before approval
3. **User Experience**: Intuitive placement alongside other post actions
4. **Consistency**: Unified edit functionality across both pending and approved post pages

## Testing

- ✅ Build completes successfully without TypeScript errors
- ✅ Edit button properly navigates to EditBlog component
- ✅ Responsive layout works on different screen sizes
- ✅ Icon and styling consistent with design system
